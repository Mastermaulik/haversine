My proudest achievement would be when I worked on Food Search Personalization which improved our Booking Conversion rate by 23%. It also improved the Search Select percentage by 14% and the users has to scroll less now by a certain un-revealable number.

I was working with one other colleague from Data Engineering team and two other engineers from Go-Food team.My role here was to first spike out approach to take for search personalization, load testing and collecting results for latency vs throughput and writing backend service to rollout personalization to a certain percentage of users.

We used Golang for this service which improved the search time from 177 ms to 80 ms. The performance improvement came mainly as the service was a monolith application written in rails.I learnt a lot about using data science against elasticsearch and golang in this project. I wrote a blog about this as well, which was shared by our CEO, CPO(Product) and Head of Data Engineering(https://blog.gojekengineering.com/how-the-gojek-butler-serves-a-gourmet-meal-to-our-users-4a161d83052a)

I will be presenting about this at O'reilly's AI Conference Beijing. This project was a collaboration effort between Data Engineering team and Go-Food.
